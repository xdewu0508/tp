### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/Redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism uses a simplified snapshot approach. Instead of maintaining a full version history, `ModelManager` stores up to two snapshots of the address book:

* `previousAddressBook` -- a copy of the address book state before the most recent mutating command (used by `undo`)
* `redoAddressBook` -- a copy of the address book state before the most recent `undo` (used by `redo`)

These are exposed in the `Model` interface as:

* `Model#saveCurrentState()` -- Saves a snapshot of the current address book for potential undo.
* `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` -- Returns true if there is a saved previous state.
* `Model#undoAddressBook()` -- Restores the address book to the previous state.
* `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` -- Returns true if there is a saved redo state.
* `Model#redoAddressBook()` -- Restores the address book to the state before the most recent undo.

The snapshot saving is handled in `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `Model#saveCurrentState()` before executing any mutating command. Non-mutating commands (`undo` and `redo`) are excluded using an `instanceof` check:

```java
Command command = addressBookParser.parseCommand(commandText);
if (!(command instanceof UndoCommand) && !(command instanceof RedoCommand)) {
    model.saveCurrentState();
}
commandResult = command.execute(model);
```

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. Both `previousAddressBook` and `redoAddressBook` are `null`. There is nothing to undo or redo.

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` to delete the 5th person. Before the command executes, `LogicManager` calls `Model#saveCurrentState()`, which saves a copy of the current address book into `previousAddressBook` and clears `redoAddressBook`. The `delete` command then executes normally.

Step 3. The user decides the delete was a mistake and executes `undo`. The `UndoCommand` calls `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which:
1. Saves the current (post-delete) state into `redoAddressBook`
2. Restores `previousAddressBook` as the active address book
3. Sets `previousAddressBook` to `null`

The deleted person is now restored.

Step 4. The user changes their mind again and executes `redo`. The `RedoCommand` calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which:
1. Saves the current (restored) state into `previousAddressBook`
2. Restores `redoAddressBook` as the active address book
3. Sets `redoAddressBook` to `null`

The person is deleted again.

Step 5. The user executes a new mutating command (e.g. `add n/David`). `LogicManager` calls `Model#saveCurrentState()`, which saves the current state into `previousAddressBook` and clears `redoAddressBook`. Since a new command was executed, redo is no longer available.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Only one level of undo/redo is supported. This is a deliberate simplification -- teachers primarily need a safety net for the most recent accidental action (e.g. accidental `clear` or `delete`), not a full multi-step history.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails during execution (e.g. invalid index), the state was already saved by `LogicManager` before execution. However, since the address book was not actually modified, the saved snapshot is identical to the current state, so an `undo` would have no visible effect.

</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves a single snapshot of the entire address book before each mutating command.
  * Pros: Simple to implement. No changes required to individual commands. No coordination needed with other developers adding new commands.
  * Cons: Only supports one level of undo/redo. Uses memory proportional to the size of the address book for each snapshot.

* **Alternative 2:** Full versioned address book with a state history list and pointer (as in AB4).
  * Pros: Supports multi-step undo/redo.
  * Cons: More complex to implement. Every mutating command must call `commitAddressBook()`, requiring coordination across the team. Higher memory usage with many states stored.

* **Alternative 3:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself (command pattern).
  * Pros: Uses less memory (e.g. for `delete`, only saves the deleted person).
  * Cons: Every command must implement its own undo logic correctly. High implementation burden and risk of bugs.

Alternative 1 was chosen because it provides the most important safety net (recovering from the last mistake) with minimal implementation complexity and zero impact on other team members' features.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Import/Export CSV feature

#### Implementation

The import/export feature is implemented in the `Logic` component using two commands:

* `ImportCommand` + `ImportCommandParser`
* `ExportCommand` + `ExportCommandParser`

Both commands are routed in `AddressBookParser` and executed by `LogicManager`, after which the normal autosave pipeline persists the updated `AddressBook` state.

**Import (`import FILE_PATH`)**

* Reads the CSV file line by line.
* Supports quoted CSV values (including commas in addresses).
* Ignores a header row if the first cell is `name`.
* Converts each row into a `Person` using existing parser utilities (`ParserUtil`) so field validation remains consistent with `add`.
* Duplicate detection uses `Model#hasPerson`, which relies on identity (`Person#isSamePerson`), i.e. same name.
* Invalid or duplicate rows are skipped and summarized in the command result.
* Up to 10 row-level skip reasons are included to help users debug malformed input.
* Strips UTF-8 BOM from the start of a line to handle CSVs exported from spreadsheet tools.

**Export (`export FILE_PATH`)**

* Serializes all persons from `model.getAddressBook().getPersonList()` into CSV.
* Writes header `name,phone,email,address,class,tags`.
* Escapes CSV values containing commas, quotes, or newlines.
* Exports tags as a semicolon-separated list.
* Creates parent directories if they do not exist.

#### Design considerations

* **Validation reuse:** import uses existing domain parsers instead of custom validators to avoid duplicated validation logic.
* **Partial success behavior:** invalid rows are skipped while valid rows are imported, improving usability for large datasets with small data issues.
* **User feedback:** row-level skip reasons are included for troubleshooting but capped for readability.

#### Manual testing

**Import**

1. Run: `import C:\data\contacts.csv` with a valid file.
   * Expected: valid rows are added and summary message shows imported count.
2. Include invalid rows (e.g. invalid phone/email).
   * Expected: rows are skipped with reasons in the result message.
3. Include a duplicate name.
   * Expected: duplicate row is skipped with a duplicate reason.

**Export**

1. Run: `export C:\data\out.csv`.
   * Expected: CSV file is created with header and all current contacts.
2. Export to a nested non-existing folder.
   * Expected: directories are created and export succeeds.
3. Export to an invalid/inaccessible path.
   * Expected: command fails with a file write error message.

### Unified sort feature

#### Implementation

Sorting is implemented using a single command:

* `SortCommand` (command word: `sort`)

`AddressBookParser` parses optional sort arguments and constructs `SortCommand` with a sort field:

* `sort` or `sort address` -> `SortField.ADDRESS`
* `sort name` -> `SortField.NAME`

`SortCommand` then selects the corresponding comparator and calls `Model#sortPersonList(...)`.

#### Design considerations

* **Single-command design:** using one command with a field parameter avoids duplicate command classes for each sort mode.
* **Extensibility:** adding future sort fields (e.g. `phone`, `class`) only requires extending the enum/parser branch and comparator mapping.
* **Backward compatibility:** `sort` continues to work with default address sorting.

#### Manual testing

1. Run `sort`.
   * Expected: persons are sorted by address.
2. Run `sort address`.
   * Expected: same behaviour as `sort`.
3. Run `sort name`.
   * Expected: persons are sorted by name.
4. Run `sort invalidField`.
   * Expected: invalid command format error with sort usage.
